What is Akonadi?
------------------
Akonadi is a PIM layer, which provides an asynchronous API to access all kind
of PIM data (e.g. mails, contacts, events, todos etc.).

It consists of several processes (generally called the Akonadi server) and a
library (called client library) which encapsulates the communication
between the client and the server.

This directory contains the sources of the Akonadi server and all the infrastructure
that is needed to build the client libraries and the application which want to make
use of Akonadi.
