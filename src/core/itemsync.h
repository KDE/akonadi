/**
 * @short Syncs between items known to a client (usually a resource) and the Akonadi storage.
 *
 * Remote Id must only be set by the resource storing the item, other clients
 * should leave it empty, since the resource responsible for the target collection
 * will be notified about the addition and then create a suitable remote Id.
 *
 * There are two different forms of ItemSync usage:
 * - Full-Sync: meaning the client provides all valid items, i.e. any item not
 *   part of the list but currently stored in Akonadi will be removed
 * - Incremental-Sync: meaning the client provides two lists, one for items which
 *   are new or modified and one for items which should be removed. Any item not
 *   part of either list but currently stored in Akonadi will not be changed.
 *
 * @note This is provided for convenience to implement "save all" like behavior,
 *       however it is strongly recommended to use single item jobs whenever
 *       possible, e.g. ItemCreateJob, ItemModifyJob and ItemDeleteJob
