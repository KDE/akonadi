/**
 * @short Monitors an item or collection for changes.
 *
 * The Monitor emits signals if some of these objects are changed or
 * removed or new ones are added to the Akonadi storage.
 *
 * There are various ways to filter these notifications. There are three types of filter
 * evaluation:
 * - (-) removal-only filter, ie. if the filter matches the notification is dropped,
 *   if not filter evaluation continues with the next one
 * - (+) pass-exit filter, ie. if the filter matches the notification is delivered,
 *   if not evaluation is continued
 * - (f) final filter, ie. evaluation ends here if the corresponding filter criteria is set,
 *   the notification is delivered depending on the result, evaluation is only continued
 *   if no filter criteria is defined
 *
 * The following filter are available, listed in evaluation order:
 * (1) ignored sessions (-)
 * (2) monitor everything (+)
 * (3a) resource and mimetype filters (f) (items only)
 * (3b) resource filters (f) (collections only)
 * (4) item is monitored (+)
 * (5) collection is monitored (+)
 *
 * Optionally, the changed objects can be fetched automatically from the server.
 * To enable this, see itemFetchScope() and collectionFetchScope().
 *
 * Note that as a consequence of rule 3a, it is not possible to monitor (more than zero resources
 * OR more than zero mimetypes) AND more than zero collections.
 *
 * @todo Distinguish between monitoring collection properties and collection content.
 * @todo Special case for collection content counts changed
