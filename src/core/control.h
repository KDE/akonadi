/**
 * @short Provides methods to control the Akonadi server process.
 *
 * This class provides synchronous methods (ie. use a sub-eventloop)
 * to control the Akonadi service. For asynchronous methods see
 * Akonadi::ServerManager.
 *
 * The most important method in here is widgetNeedsAkonadi(). It is
 * recommended to call it with every top-level widget of your application
 * as argument, assuming your application relies on Akonadi being operational
 * of course.
 *
 * While the Akonadi server automatically started by Akonadi::Session
 * on first use, it might be necessary for some use-cases to guarantee
 * a running Akonadi service at some point. This can be done using
 * start().
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * if ( !Akonadi::Control::start() ) {
 *   qDebug() << "Unable to start Akonadi server, exit application";
 *   return 1;
 * } else {
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
