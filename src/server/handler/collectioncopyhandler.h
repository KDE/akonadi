  Handler for the CollectionCopyHandler command.

  This command is used to copy a single collection into another collection, including
  all sub-collections and their content.

  The copied items differ in the following points from the originals:
  - new unique id
  - empty remote id
  - possible located in a different collection (and thus resource)

  The copied collections differ in the following points from the originals:
  - new unique id
  - empty remote id
  - owning resource is the same as the one of the target collection
