/**

  Handler for the LIST command.

  This command is used to get a (limited) listing of the available collections.
  It is different from the LIST command and is more similar to FETCH.

  The @c RID command prefix indicates that @c collection-id is a remote identifier
  instead of a unique identifier. In this case a resource context has to be specified
  previously using the @c RESSELECT command.

  @c depths chooses between recursive (@c INF), flat (1) and local (0, ie. just the
  base collection) listing, 0 indicates the root collection.

  The @c filter-list is used to restrict the listing to collection of a specific
  resource or content type.

  The @c option-list allows to specify the response content to some extend:
  - @c STATISTICS (boolean) allows to include the collection statistics (see Status)
  - @c ANCESTORDEPTH (numeric) allows you to specify the number of ancestor nodes that
    should be included additionally to the @c parent-id included anyway.
    Possible values are @c 0 (the default), @c 1 for the direct parent node and @c INF for all,
    terminating with the root collection.

  The name is encoded as an quoted UTF-8 string. There is no order defined for the
  single responses.

  The ancestors property is encoded as a list of UID/RID pairs.
