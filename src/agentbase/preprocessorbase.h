 * @short The base class for all Akonadi preprocessor agents.
 *
 * This class should be used as a base class by all preprocessor agents
 * since it encapsulates large parts of the protocol between
 * preprocessor agent, agent manager and the Akonadi storage.
 *
 * Preprocessor agents are special agents that are informed about newly
 * added items before any other agents. This allows them to do filtering
 * on the items or any other task that shall be done before the new item
 * is visible in the Akonadi storage system.
 *
 * The method all the preprocessors must implement is processItem().
