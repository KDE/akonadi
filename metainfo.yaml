    long_description:
        - KDE PIM provides a set of libraries and applications to access and
          manage personal information like emails, contacts, events, etc.
        - KDE PIM provides a set of libraries to parse and interact with various
          standardized PIM data formats, like RFC822 (KMime), ICAL (KCalendarCore)
          or VCARD (KContacts).
        - The backbone of the entire suite is Akonadi, the PIM storage framework.
          Akonadi provides unified API to access and manage any kind of PIM data
          regardless of the actual storage backend.
        - There are quite a few other libraries that provide PIM-specific widgets
          and utilities and can be useful for application developers who need to
          work with PIM data in their projects.
        - Please note that unless stated otherwise, none of the libraries have
          stable API or ABI as of now. We are trying to keep the changes small and
          we always announce big changes ahead on the mailing lists, but as the
          project evolves we might need to adjust some API here and there.
